# BAND ALIGNMENT

### *About*

- MicaSense RedEdge's five viewers (and lenses) are not mechanically registered or aligned. It is therefore necessary to align the bands of images taken using such cameras. In this study, this problem was addressed and a solution was sought for the alignment of the NIR band to the RED band, or vice versa.
 
-  * Due to the fact that the images belong to agricultural land, two bands used in the calculation of NDVI, which is the most widely used plant index, were selected.

- Code to reduce images meaningfully -- [NIR_REDbuffer](https://github.com/zeynepmirayertunc/image_alignment/blob/master/NIR_REDbuffer.py)
- Code showing how different the images are from each another -- [NIR_REDdifferences](https://github.com/zeynepmirayertunc/image_alignment/blob/master/NIR_REDdifferences.py)
